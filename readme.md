Arkanoid Java
=

The small Arkanoid clone I wrote with a little bit of knowledge about Java language using standard libraries only during the weekend 5-7.08.2016.

Rules
=

Destroy colorful blocks hovering above your paddle with the white ball you can bounce. When you destroy them new set of the blocks is spawned with doubled quantity. There is no end-game condition however when there will be like 10 sets of the blocks at your screen it may be problematic to play further :).


Controls
=

* A/D or Left/Right - moving of the paddle
* ESC - pause
* ENTER - restart game when game is over
